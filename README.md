# Project-1-GB

##Description

We have created an application that will, based on a inputed location, tell the user the weather forecast (7 day forecast). It will also bring up a map of the area searched for a fixed radius and a list of avilable hiking trails, if there are any in the searched radius. If no hiking trails are found within the searched radius the user is prompted to zoom out on the map to increase the search radius. The user can then click on a hiking trail to get more information about it.

##Installation

No installation needed. The code is deployed as a stand alone page on Git Pages, (https://troy-earle.github.io/Project-1-GB/)

##Usage

From the landing page, the user is met with a seach bar
